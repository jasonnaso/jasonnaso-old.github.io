His skill and mastery for creating exactly what you need continually exceeds our expectations. We consider Mr. Naso's work to be an integral part of our award-winning space. Our Salon won Salon of the Year 2015 in no small part because of his ingenuity, design eye and skill for making the ordinary beautiful. It's worth mentioning that his prices are fair and honest.</p>

The craftsmanship is of the highest quality, and met with my complete satisfaction. I was given sound advice on selecting high quality materials, and in the design of the spaces. The craftsmen who worked in my home were on task at all times. They were pleasant, efficient, and very thorough. I recommend this firm without reservation.</p>

I have had the pleasure of knowing David as an artist for a little over a decade. David has helped to create the “drama and theater” of my shop, a sensuality that is pronounced through the work he does in wood and is projected into the personality of my space. I love that he is passionate about his work and that passion is shared. The attention to detail in his work is absorbing, it continues to impact how you view and live with his work…it has become immortal and as such will live on for generations. I’m very happy and proud to possess a David Naso original work of art.</p>
